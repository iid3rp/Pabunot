# iid3rp's indie Game Portfolios | Pabunot

In the midst of situations, Palabunutan, in general, holds a special place in our hearts and me.
A pang of nostalgia within the bittersweet memories of our childhood.
But let's face it, there's a certain wasteful aspect to it.
I just believe that it is extremely wasteful to buy a lot of palabunutan, those colorful paper sticks, for just one use.
Each game ends in a scattered mess, a fleeting moment of fun leaving 
behind a pile of colored debris.
<b> we don't want that lol</b>

This inherent wastefulness, however, this innovation sparked me in some resourceful minds. 
When I had to experience of having to try a palabunutan in a sari-sari store,
it inspired the creation of a reusable Palabunot set.
**With a java game twist!!!**
This way, the thrill of the game 
could be enjoyed again and again without the environmental guilt of disposable parts. 

This innovation could not only address the wastefulness but also elevate Palabunot 
to a more sustainable and strategic game. 
Players would develop a great, catchy, vibrant graphical, animated
affect the overall structure, adding a new layer of digital touch to the traditional gameplay.
